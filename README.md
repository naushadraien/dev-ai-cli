## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) installed
- Google Gemini API key
- Windows (for voice feature)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/naushadraien/dev-ai-cli.git
cd dev-ai-cli
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

3. Create a `.env` file and add your Gemini API key:

```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

4. Link the CLI globally:

## Usage

### Ask AI anything

```bash
# Basic usage
devai "How do I create a React component?"
devai "Explain async/await in JavaScript"

# With voice output
devai "What is TypeScript?" -v
devai "Explain promises" --voice
```

### Format standup notes

```bash
# Basic usage
devai formatStandup "worked on lockgate feature, added CSS styling, fixed auth bug"

# Save to file (appends and merges if file exists)
devai formatStandup "fixed login bug, added validation" -o "C:\Users\YourName\Desktop\job.txt"

# With voice output
devai formatStandup "huntgate: fixed ui issue" -v

# With both file output and voice
devai formatStandup "fixed bugs, added features" -o "./standup.txt" -v

# Show all of today's standups after saving
devai formatStandup "huntgate: fixed bug" -o "./job.txt" -a

# Combine all options
devai formatStandup "lockgate: added css" -o "./job.txt" -a -v
```

## Smart Standup Merging

When saving to a file, the CLI intelligently merges standups:

- **Same day, same project** → Tasks are merged under the same project
- **Same day, different project** → New project section is added
- **Different day** → New date section is created
- **Duplicate tasks** → Automatically ignored

### Example

```bash
# 9 AM - First standup
devai formatStandup "huntgate: fixed bug" -o "./Job.txt"
# File content:
# Updates [17/12/2025 - Wednesday]:-
# Huntgate:
# - Fixed bug

# 12 PM - Add more to same project
devai formatStandup "huntgate: added css" -o "./Job.txt"
# File content (merged):
# Updates [17/12/2025 - Wednesday]:-
# Huntgate:
# - Fixed bug
# - Added CSS

# 3 PM - Add different project
devai formatStandup "lockgate: api done" -o "./Job.txt" -a
# Output shows all today's standups:
# 📋 Today's Complete Standup:
#
# Updates [17/12/2025 - Wednesday]:-
# Huntgate:
# - Fixed bug
# - Added CSS
#
# Lockgate:
# - Completed API
```

## Tech Stack

- **Runtime:** [Bun](https://bun.sh) v1.3.3
- **AI:** Google Gemini (gemini-2.5-flash)
- **CLI Framework:** [Commander.js](https://github.com/tj/commander.js)
- **Styling:** [Chalk](https://github.com/chalk/chalk)
- **Spinner:** [Ora](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ora)
- **Voice:** Windows Speech Synthesis (Microsoft Zira)

## Voice Configuration

The voice feature uses Windows built-in speech synthesis with the following defaults:

- **Voice:** Microsoft Zira Desktop (Female US English)
- **Rate:** -2 (slightly slower than normal)

Available voices on Windows:

- `Microsoft Zira Desktop` - Female US English
- `Microsoft David Desktop` - Male US English
- `Microsoft Mark Desktop` - Male US English

To list all available voices on your system:

```powershell
powershell -Command "Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Speech; $speak = New-Object System.Speech.Synthesis.SpeechSynthesizer; $speak.GetInstalledVoices() | ForEach-Object { $_.VoiceInfo.Name }"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Command not found

If `devai` command doesn't work, try running directly:

```powershell
& "C:\Users\YourName\.bun\bin\devai.exe" formatStandup "your standup data"
```

### File not saving to Desktop

Your Desktop might be synced with OneDrive. Check the actual path:

```powershell
[Environment]::GetFolderPath("Desktop")
```

Use the returned path instead (e.g., `C:\Users\YourName\OneDrive\Desktop\Job.txt`)

### Voice not working

Make sure you're running on Windows and have speech synthesis installed:

```powershell
powershell -Command "Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Speech; $speak = New-Object System.Speech.Synthesis.SpeechSynthesizer; $speak.Speak('Hello')"
```
